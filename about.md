### Hello. 

My name is [Harper Reed](http://harperreed.com). I build a lot of technology and attempt at all costs to live in the future. 

I have been using Control4 for a few years now and have been largely unhappy with the various drivers that allow me to push my events outside of my "closed" control4 system. 

I decided to try and make some drivers that solved some of the problems that I wanted to solve. 

### Drivers: 

- [Webhook Events driver](/realtime-event-webhook)
- Nanoleaf Aurora Driver
- Tesla driver
- Awair driver

Obviously YMMV with all of this.

Let me know if you have questions.
